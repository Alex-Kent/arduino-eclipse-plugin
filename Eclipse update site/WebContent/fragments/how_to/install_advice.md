Product Versus plugin
===
The plugin and the product are the same thing but they are packaged differently.   
When you install the product you install the plugin and eclipse and other things that the arduino eclipse plugin development team thinks is interesting to have.   
The plugin needs to be added to a eclipse installation that has CDT installed.   

**reasons to use the product**   
You do not have eclipse on you system.     
This is your first contact with the Arduino Eclipse plugin.     
Easy install.  
Fasted way to get started.   

**reasons to use the plugin**   
It is easier for your situation to start from another eclipse product and add the arduino eclipse plugin than the other way around.   
For instance because  you already have that product (with extensions) on your system.   

Which version   
===
If you want to use Arduino IDE 1.0.x you need V1.   
If you want to use Arduino IDE 1.5.x till 1.6.3 you need V2.   
Everybody else (which should be about everybody) should go for V3.   
Unless advised differently: Only go for the nightly if you feel comfortable with the arduino eclipse plugin and eclipse.   

Java
===
V1 needs java 6
V2 needs jave 7
V3 needs java 8
