How to configure for Teensy
===========================

*trippylighting* (a very nice guy) has done some very good documentation on how to use the Teensy boards with the Arduino Eclipse plugin.

Please see [his website](http://trippylighting.com/teensy-arduino-ect/arduino-eclipse-plugin/) for detailed Teensy related stuff.

**Users of V3**  
Teensyduino 1.27 needs some modifications before you can use it.  
It is expected that TeensyDuino 1.28 will work without modifications.  
To get this to work add [teensyduino]/hardware/teensy to the additional hardware paths.  

**Users of the Arduino eclipse plugin version 2.4 **  
The arduino eclipse plugin support teensyduino 1.21 (and later) like arduino IDE.
So basically there is no longer a difference between using teensyduino and Arduino IDE.



**The old answer version 2.3 &nd earlier**  
Working with Teensy and the Eclipse plugin is possible but asks some work.
