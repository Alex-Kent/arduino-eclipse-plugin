<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
<accordion close-others="true">
  <accordion-group heading="The plugin doesn't work on my system.">
   <p>If it doesn't work with the  Arduino IDE it won't work with Sloeber. Can you compile in the Arduino IDE?</p>
   <p>Do you have the right 64 bit java installed and configured properly?</p>
   <p>Have you configured Sloeber correctly?</p>
   <p>Have you installed in program files? The plugin does not support spaces in the path.</p>
   <p>Ask yourself: What doesn't work?</p>
  </accordion-group>
  <accordion-group heading="The serial (monitor) doesn't work on my system.">
   <p>In the newer versions of the plugin it should work.</p>
   For older versions verify serial communication is active.<br>
   Goto windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;Arduino-&gt;Arduino and check wether "Disable RX TX" is unchecked.<br>
   At the same location press the "test serial dll" button to verify there is a vallid dll for your OS.<br>
   If the RXTX dll is enabled and there is a valid rxtx dll found for your OS/Eclipse combination it works on
    most OS's (<a href="https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin/issues/7">there is a known issue in Linux flavours </a>)<br>
  </accordion-group>
  <accordion-group heading="On Linux I have no serial ports available.">
  <p>In the newer versions of the plugin it should work.</p>
  On some linux distro's the dll used will not find any serial ports.<br>
  To fix this add following line to your eclipse.ini after -vmargs<br>
  <pre>-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM1:/dev/ttyACM2:/dev/ttyACM3:/dev/ttyUSB0::/dev/ttyUSB1::/dev/ttyUSB2::/dev/ttyUSB3::/dev/ttyUSB4</pre><br>

  <accordion-group heading="How can I find out more of the problem at hand?">
   <p>Thanks for asking.</p>
   <p>It is always a good idea to find out more about the problem at hand.</p>
   <p>There are actually 3  Eclipse views that can give you more feedback on the problem at hand.</p>
   <ul><li>The console view</li>
   <li>The problems view</li>
   <li>The errors view</li></ul>
   The console view gives you more information on the commands that are being run externally.
   That is the compiler and avr dude. The commands should be nearly 100% the same as in the Arduino IDE (the order is not always relevant).
   Differences I am aware of are
   <ul><li>-D__IN_ECLIPSE__=1: that specifies you are in Eclipse.</li>
   <li>-x c++: An option I added to force *.pde and *.ino to be treated as C++ files (the latest versions of Arduino do this also)</ul>
   The problems view gives an overview of the code problems and is probably not what you are looking for when you are reading this.<br><br>
   The error view gives you an overview of errors and warnings that happened in Eclipse and or its plugins.
   To show the errors window: select Window-&gt;show view -&gt; other-&gt;select general tab-&gt;error log.
   Look at the plugin column to see which plugin logged the warning.
   I can only tell you more about the errors and warnings generated by io.sloeber.* plugins.

   <br><br>A final and most time consuming way to find the problem is to download the code from github. You can then compile and debug the code.<a name="spaces"></a>
  </accordion-group>
  <accordion-group heading="Can I use spaces?">
    The usage of spaces is known to give problems.<br>
  </accordion-group>
  <accordion-group heading="Eclipse tells me there are bugs in my code but it compiles ok.">
  <p>Eclipse compiles your code in 2 ways. Once when you request a build (when you press on the hammer or the verify icon) by the compiler and ones when you change code by the indexer.</p>
  <p>The compiler is responsible for the build and the indexer is responsible for the editing experience.</p>

<p>The bugs (the red animals in the code) you see in the code can be found by any of the 2.</p>
<p>To start the compiler to remove compiler found issues (That are the once you also see in the console view) simply verify the sketch.</p>
<p>To force the indexer to "reconsider" the bugs. right click the project and select index->rebuild.</p>
<p>In older versions of Eclipse the indexer behaves weird and sometimes doesn't find declarations that it knows. In that case you have the bug icon without actually having a bug (in other words the code compiles ok but the indexer thinks it will not).</p>
<p>In Indigo the following actions can solve the serial problem. (note I have been thinking other solutions solved the problem)</p>
<br>Setting the preference windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;C/C++-&gt;indexer-&gt;Files to index upfront . Add arduino.h and or WProgram.h including the full path. With me it currently states &quot;D:/arduino-1.0.1/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/Arduino.h,cstdarg, stdarg.h, stddef.h, sys/resource.h, ctime, sys/types.h, signal.h, cstdio&quot;.<br><br>

<p> In all cases the bugs can appear if you never compiled the code. There is also some delay for the indexer to find things.</p>
<p>When using ino files and no headers are included include "Arduino.h" to make them go away. This is caused by the solution used to support .ino files.</p>

  </accordion-group>
  <accordion-group heading="Where is the elf file?">
  <p>When you have compiled the sketch sometimes you can not see the elf file in eclipse. </p>
  This is a bug related to eclipse. If your project compiled fine refresh the project (press F5 when you have the project selected).<br>
  Now there should be a binaries folder in the root of your project containing the elf file.<br>
  Note that just like in the Arduino IDE there is no reason to &quot;see&quot; the elf file.

  <accordion-group heading="I can not cancel the upload to the Arduino board.">

Someone reported that pressing the cancel button during upload to Arduino locks the com port.  Even if the upload is not working.  To solve the lock problem in windows unplug the Arduino  -after all connections to the com port have been closed -from your pc and replug.<br>

  <accordion-group heading="On Mac I get the error &quot;serial port is in use&quot; when uploading.">
The upload will be successfull with Arduino IDE 1.0 and higher unless you are uploading to a mega.
Run following terminal commands to fix the problem:<br>
<br> $ sudo mkdir /var/lock
<br>$ sudo chmod 777 /var/lock<br>
