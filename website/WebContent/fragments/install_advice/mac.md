There are some mac fans using Sloeber. Mac support has grown over the years with input of mac users. The latest version should be as Mac like as eclipse can be.
We even have a mac contributor now.[Maarten](https://github.com/mjmeijer)


**Here are some mac specific issues:**

Mac has implemented some rules for download safety that will affect you. [Do not launch from the download location.](http://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/app-translocation.html)

**some issues in older versions**

[the error "serial port is in use" when uploading](http://eclipse.baeyens.it/rlogiacco/faq.shtml#/troubleshooting) should no longer exists from version 2.4 onwards.

In the 1.5 series there has been a change in the folder structure on mac from arduino IDE 1.5.7 onwards. See [this issue](https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin/pull/180) for more detail.
